Daily Boost

This is a web app I've built using NextJS/React with HTML & CSS.

This app makes a couple of API calls to first, load in a list of quotes and second, to analyze the emotions in the quotes. This is achieved using an Emotion Analysis API and a Quotes API. With this information, the quotes are then sorted based on how much "joy" they have. In the end, I only focus on the quote with the highest score for "joy".


TODO: 
- Add a Button to trigger the execution
- Implement a text to speech API so that an audio player is displayed containing an audio file of the quote being said
